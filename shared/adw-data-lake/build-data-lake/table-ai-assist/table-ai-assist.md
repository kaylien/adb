# Enhance Data for Analytics Using the Table AI Assist Tool

## Introduction

In this lab, you will use the **Table AI Assist** tool to prepare and enhance data for analytics. You can use this tool to add, remove, and rename columns in a table using AI assistance. This enables you to augment or correct data found in tables in your local schema using natural language AI prompts. You can add columns for day, month, quarter and year using data in a date column or add a distance column from two columns with geographical co-ordinates.

For example you can derive separate columns from a single date column for time-based reporting, or calculate the distance between two geographical co-ordinates and add that as a new column. The Table AI Assist tool works by using your configured AI profile to generate SQL to prepare your data. The output of the tool can then be a new view on top of your source table, or a new table.

You can prepare data using the Table AI Assist Tool by performing the following:

* Add, replace, remove, and rename a column
* View Statistical Details about the Table you Load after you Create a Recipe
* View Table Entity Details

You will use the Table AI Assist tool to create recipes. A recipe is a set of steps. Each step lets you add, replace, remove, or rename columns without making any changes to your source table. You add as many steps as you want to a recipe. You can save a recipe to your schema or export it as JSON to a file. You can return back to your saved recipe and keep working on it.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Navigate to the **Table AI Assist** page.
* Create an OCI credential.
* Create an AI profile.
* Create tables and load data from public object storage buckets using Data Tools built-in to Oracle Autonomous Database.

### Prerequisites

This lab requires completion of **Lab 1: Set up the Workshop Environment > Task 3: Create an Autonomous Data Warehouse Instance**, from the **Contents** menu on the left.

## Task 1: Configure Your AI Profile

In this task, you will use the Data Studio **Settings** on the Data Studio tool to create your OCI credential and AI profile to provide access to Cloud Services.

## Task 2: Load Data from a Public Object Storage Bucket and Create Tables

In this task, you will load data into your ADB instance from the **MovieStream** data lake on [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/storage/object-storage.html) in preparation for data analysis.

You can load data into your Autonomous Database (either Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse or Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing) using the ADB built-in tools. In this task, you will load data from a public object storage bucket and create the following tables in your Autonomous Database instance: **`customer`**, **`custsales`**, and **`genre`**. You will use the new tables in the next two tasks.

1. On the **Data Load Dashboard**, click the **Load Data** tile.

    ![Click Load Data.](images/click-load-data.png)

2. On the **Load Data** page, click the **Cloud Store** tab to select objects from URLs or cloud store links.

    ![Select Link Data and Cloud Store.](images/click-cloud-store.png)

3. Copy the following object storage URL and paste it in the **Select Cloud Store Location or enter public URL** field. The **`moviestream_landing`** Oracle Object Storage bucket that contains the data is located in a different tenancy than yours, **c4u04**; therefore, you will use the following URL.

    ```
    <copy>
    https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/n/c4u04/b/moviestream_landing/o
    </copy>
    ```

4. A list of the folders in the selected Object Storage bucket is displayed on left side section of the page. You can drag and drop the desired folders from this public bucket from this section to the data linking job section on the right.

    ![The Load Cloud Object page appears](images/bucket-folders-displayed.png)

5. Drag the **`customer`** folder and drop it onto the data loading job canvas.

    ![Drag the customer folder](images/drag-drop-customer.png)

6. A **Load to Single Target Table** dialog box is displayed to prompt you whether or not you want to load all objects in this folder matching **.csv** to a single target table. This folder contains a single file, `customer.csv`. In general, data lake folders contain many files of the same type, as you will see with sales data. Click **Yes**.

    ![Click yes to load objects to a single table.](images/click-yes.png =60%x*)

    The **`customer`** target table to be created for the selected `.csv` file is displayed in the data loading job section.

    ![Click yes to load objects to a single table.](images/load-to-single-table.png " ")

7. The **Analyze File Warnings** found one Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Click the **customer** file name link.

    ![Click the customer file.](images/click-customer-file.png =65%x*)

8. The **Load Data from Cloud Store Location customer** dialog box is displayed. The **EMAIL** field contains the PII information. In the **Mapping section**, click the **Expand or Collapse Mapping Panel** icon.

    ![Click Expand icon.](images/click-expand-icon.png " ")

9. Let's preview the data. Click the **Preview** tab, and then click **Load Preview**. The **EMAIL** column contains PII. We will correct that in the **Create a Recipe** task. Click **Close**.

    ![Email column.](images/email-column.png " ")

10. Click **Start** to create the **customer** table and load it with data from the **customer.csv** file.

    ![Click start.](images/click-start.png " ")

11. A **Start Load from Cloud Store** message is displayed. Click **Run**. The **customer** table is created.

    ![Customer table is created.](images/customer-table-created.png " ")

12. Create the **`custsales`** table. Click the **Load Data** tile. Drag the **`custsales`** folder and and drop it onto the data loading job section. When the **Load to Single Target Table** dialog box is displayed, click **Yes**.

13. Create the **`genre`** table that we will use in the next task. Drag the **`genre`** folder and drop it onto the data loading job section. Click **Yes** when prompted.

    ![Drag and drop two more folders.](images/drag-drop-2-folders.png)

14. Click **Start** to create the **`genre`** and **`custsales`** tables. When prompted to run, click **Run**.

    The two tables are created.

    ![The tables are created.](images/tables-created.png " ")

## Task 3: Create a Recipe

### What is a Recipe?

In this task, you will work with the data preparation tool to create recipes. A recipe is a set of steps. You can use a step to add, replace, remove, and rename columns without making any changes to your base (source) table. You can add as many steps as you want to a recipe. You can then save a recipe to your schema or export it as JSON to a file. You can then return back to your saved recipe and keep working on it as needed.

### Different modes of Recipe

The following are different modes of a recipe:

* Create or Replace View
* Create a new table
* Alter table

Once you are satisfied with a recipe you can use it to create or replace a view, create a new table, or alter the table.

1. In the Navigation menu on the left, click **Table AI Assist**.

    ![Click Table AI Assist.](./images/click-ai-assist.png =65%x*)

    The **Table AI Assist SQL Recipes** page is displayed. The tables that you have created so far are displayed.

    ![The Table AI Assist SQL Recipes page is displayed.](./images/table-ai-assist-recipes.png " ")

2. For the **customer** table, click **+ New Recipe**. The **Edit Recipe** page is displayed. Note the **EMAIL** column that contains PII that we will correct now.

    ![The Table AI Assist SQL Recipes page is displayed.](./images/edit-recipe-page.png " ")

3. Click **Add Step**. The **Add Step** panel is displayed.

    ![The Add Step panel is displayed.](./images/add-step-panel.png =60%x*)

4. In the **Enter a prompt in natural language or specify SQL for column** text field, provide some natural language prompt of what you want to do such as **`The email column contains PII. Please replace everything before the @ with ***`**. Next, click **Ask AI**.

    ![Click Ask AI.](./images/click-ask-ai.png =60%x*)

    A new generated **EMAIL_1** column is displayed in the **Data Preview** section. The new column shows the masked PII in the email addresses. Note the generated SQL that performs this operation which you can also edit and run if you are familiar with SQL.

    ![New column created.](./images/new-column-created.png =60%x*)

5. In this case, since you are masking the PII from the email column, select the **Replace Column** option, and then select the **email** column name from the **Column Name to Replace** drop-down list.

    ![Replace email column.](./images/replace-email-column.png =60%x*)

6. Click **Add Step**. The **Edit Recipe** page is re-displayed. Scroll to the right of the table to display the newly added masked email column.

    ![Click Add Step.](./images/replaced-email-column.png " ")

7. Let's perform some demographics operations such as getting the birth year from the **age** column. Click **Add Step**. In the **Enter a prompt in natural language or specify SQL for column** text field, provide some natural language prompt of what you want to do such as **`birth year from the age column`**. Next, click **Ask AI**.

    ![birth year from the age column.](./images/birth-year.png =60%x*)

    The new **BIRTH_YEAR** column is displayed in the **Data Preview** section. The SQL expression that was used to create this column is displayed in the **SQL** field.

8. Click **Add Step**. The **Edit Recipe** page is re-displayed. Scroll to the right of the table to display the newly added **BIRTH_YEAR** column.

    ![Birth Year column is displayed.](./images/birth-year-column.png " ")

9. Let's perform one more data preparation. Click **Add Step**. In the **Enter a prompt in natural language or specify SQL for column** text field, provide some natural language prompt of what you want to do such as **`generation name from the birth year column`**. Next, click **Ask AI**. The new **generation_name** column is displayed in the **Data Preview** section.

    ![generation name from the birth year column.](./images/generation-name-column.png =60%x*)

10. Click **Add Step**. The **Edit Recipe** page is re-displayed. Scroll to the right of the table to display the newly added **GENERATION_NAME** column.

    ![The generation_name column is displayed.](./images/generation-name-column-displayed.png " ")

11. Finally, let's save the modified **customer** table as a new table named **`customer_enhanced`**. Click the **Target Type** drop-down list and select **Create Table**. Change the table name in the **Target Name** field to **`customer_enhanced`**, and then click **Create Table**.

    ![Click Create Table.](./images/click-create-table.png " ")

12. A **Create Table** dialog box is displayed. Click **Yes**.

    ![Create Table dialog box.](./images/click-yes-dialog.png " ")

    A **Confirmation** message box is displayed. The table is created.

    ![Confirmation message box.](./images/confirmation.png =60%x*)

## Task 4: Analyze Data

In this task, you will analyze data using the Analysis tool which enables you to create Analytic Views with multidimensional metadata. You create Analytic Views on top of a fact table with several dimensions and hierarchies. Analytic views refer to tables in the database and allow users to create hierarchies for dimensions. You can also create Analyses and reports using information from the Analytic Views.

You can access the Data Analysis page from the Database Actions Launchpad. Click the **Data Studio** tab and then the **Data Analysis** tab.

![Access the tool from Launchpad.](./images/access-tool-launchpad.png " ")

1. You can also access the Data Analysis page from the Navigation menu. Click **Analysis**.
We will work with the **custsales** data. Click **View All** to display all the tables.

    ![Click View All.](./images/click-view-all.png " ")

2. Click **custsales**.

    ![Click custsales.](./images/click-custsales.png " ")

    A **Select Schema** informational box is displayed. Close it.

3. The **custsales** query returns **`The given query has returned large data`** error in the **Query Result** section. There is a limit on displaying only one million rows in this window.

    ![custsales error.](./images/custsales-error.png =65%x*)

    The **custsales** table contains around 2.5 million rows.

    ![custsales rows count.](./images/custsales-rows-count.png =65%x*)

4. Add the `Fetch` clause to the `SELECT` statement, and then click **Run**. This will only show the first 10 rows in the table.

    ```sql
    <copy>
    FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY;
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Run query.](./images/run-query.png " ")

5. Enable the **Use Natural Query** slider.

    ![Enable natural language query.](./images/enable-natural-language.png " ")

6. Click **Select Tables** and select the **customer_enhanced**, **custsales**, and **genre** tables. Click anywhere in the SQL Editor to dismiss the list of tables.

    ![Select tables.](./images/select-tables.png " ")

7. Let's ask a natural question. Enter **`Find the top 10 genres from millennials`** as a prompt in the **Enter Natural Query** text field, and then click **Generate Query**.

    ![Generate query.](./images/generate-query.png " ")

    The **customer_enhanced**, **custsales**, and **genre** tables were joined to generate the result. You can review the generated SQL query. You can also edit and run the query.

    ![Results](./images/result.png " ")

8. If you are not very familiar with SQL, you can click **AI Explain** to review the steps used to obtain the result in an easy-to-understand format.

    ![Click AI Explain](./images/click-ai-explain.png " ")

    The query explanation is displayed. Review the steps, and then click **Close**.

    ![Query explanation.](./images/query-explain.png " ")

9. Click the **Save** drop-down list, and then select **Save Analysis As**.

    ![Select Save Analysis.](./images/save-analysis-as.png " ")

10. In the **Create New Analysis** dialog box, enter a meaningful name and then click **Save Analysis**.

    ![Enter a name for the analysis](./images/create-new-analysis.png =60%x*)

    The named analysis is displayed.

    ![The named analysis is displayed.](./images/named-analysis.png " ")

11. You can access your saved analyses from the **Analysis** page. Click the **Entity Type** drop-down list and select **Analysis**. Your saved analysis from the previous step is displayed. Click the **Customer Analysis** image. You can also use the **Actions** (ellipsis) icon to display the context menu.
